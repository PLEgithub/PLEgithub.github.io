# Project Overview: Serial Content Showcase

## Project Description

A self-contained platform for anyone who wants to present their own content to be distributed/displayed (hosted both onsite & offsite), along with pages for biographical information, possibly a small storefront page, etc.  Primary goal will be to capture and retain users to view as much content as possible, while providing an effortless but enjoyable UX.

| Site Url        | Desired Features           | 
| ------------- |-------------| 
|[Disrupticon](http://murielm.github.io/fewd-34/Homework/disrupticon)| - transform:rotate property (possibly for some type of transition?) |
|[Erlyn](http://www.drinkerlyn.com/)| - image opacity transition (rule-based?), under “Re-Stock Your Bar” section | 

###Next Steps:  
- sitemap/tree (additional pages), including:
	- home/welcome
	- about(bio)/content description
	- content viewing page
	- product page?
	- about this site?
- layout of content page? (i.e. playlist & view portal)
- video embedding options (for offsite hosting)
	- any interesting design options?

###Questions to answer:
- For mobile viewing, if transitioning between light, text-filled content pages and a landscape, full-screen viewing experience (video), is it a more optimal user experience to have the mobile site initially load in landscape mode?  

## Wireframes

Include wireframes for all pages included in the site including:

### Landing Page

#### Desktop

#### Tablet
- Virtually the same as desktop layout

#### Mobile

## MVP 

The primary purpose of the site will be to showcase the content created by a certain entity (a person, artist, group, etc.). Primary goal will be to capture and retain users to view as much content as possible. Potential to create fun, interesting way to view/surround content on larger screens (desktops and maybe tablets), however mobile experience will transition from simple, informational pages to a full-screen viewing experience. Site features will include:  

- basic navigation
- simple text pages with descriptive information
- content page with playlist/showcase of assets (videos)
- possible storefront? 

## POST MVP

TBD. After overall content consumption, secondary MVP will be either an additional innovative UX design to add something unique to the desktop experience, and/or possibly adding some type of storefront page to drive users to conversion post-view.
